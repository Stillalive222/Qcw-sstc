# Qcw-sstc
This project demonstrates a **Quasi-Continuous Wave Solid State Tesla Coil (QCW SSTC)** implementation, inspired by and based on the [QCW SSTC design thread on High Voltage Forum](https://highvoltageforum.net/index.php?topic=1412.0). The QCW technique uses a **linearly ramped bus voltage** to produce long, sword-like arcs.
